let firstName = 'john'
let lastName = 'Doe'
console.log(firstName + lastName)
//concatenation using space
console.log(firstName + ' '+ lastName)
//space can also be given while declaring name
const value = 'john'
console.log(value);//when this value should not be changed



// if we wanna re-declare the value.... can be done as follows..

let variable = 'constant'
console.log('the value before varieng is >>> '+ variable)
variable = 'varied'
console.log('the value after changing is '+variable)
